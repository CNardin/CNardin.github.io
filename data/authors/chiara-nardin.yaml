    summary: |
      Developed a computational framework for seismic fragility assessment of industrial non-structural components using experiments, FE models, and surrogate-based uncertainty quantification.
    #  Nowadays, earthquakes are among the most destructive natural catastrophes.
    #  Based on observations of damage following recent disastrous seismic events
    #  and numerical studies, it emerges that critical non-structural components
    #  (NSCs), ubiquitous to most industrial facilities, are particularly and even
    #  disproportionately vulnerable to earthquakes.
#
    #  Nonetheless, seismic provisions for industrial facilities and their process
    #  equipment are still based on classical load-and-resistance factor design;
    #  a performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) approach should instead
    #  be preferred.
#
    #  However, recent research within a PBEE perspective remarked:
    #  (i) a lack of definition of performance objectives for NSCs;
    #  (ii) a gap in fully comprehensive testing campaigns on coupled
    #  NSC–structure systems.
#
    #  In this respect, this PhD thesis introduces a computational framework for
    #  efficient and accurate seismic fragility analysis based on experimental
    #  test data, refined FE models, and surrogate-based uncertainty quantification.
    #  State-dependent fragility curves are derived using polynomial chaos expansion
    #  (PCE) surrogate models with dimensionality reduction via PCA.

#      Structural engineer and MSCA postdoctoral fellow at the Chair of Risk, Safety \& Uncertainty Quantification ([RSUQ](https://sudret.ibk.ethz.ch/)), ETH Zurich, and at the Hazard Mitigation, Structural Dynamics and Control ([HMSDC](https://researchcenter.unitn.it/en/nhmsdc)) group, University of Trento. She received her Ph.D. in Modelling and Simulation in 2022 at the University of Trento with a thesis on seismic experimental analyses and surrogate models of multi-component systems in special-risk industrial facilities. Her research focuses on seismic risk analysis, fragility assessment, uncertainty quantification, surrogate modelling, and machine learning for industrial facilities. She actively participated in the EU H2020 SERA–SPIF project and is currently developing state-dependent fragility frameworks for complex time-dependent industrial systems.
