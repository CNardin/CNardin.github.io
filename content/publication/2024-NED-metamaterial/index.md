> [!ABSTRACT]
> This paper investigates the seismic protection of the Nuward™ small modular reactor (SMR) building, focusing
on design loading and beyond design basis earthquake (bDBE) conditions. The study aims to achieve two primary
objectives: (i) to enhance seismic mitigation of a SMR building under bDBE conditions, through the use of the
innovative modular single-layer (SLM) and multi-layer (MLM) metafoundations (MFs); (ii) to effectively standardise
and harmonise SMR building designs in locations prone to beyond design basis conditions. To accomplish
these goals and demonstrate the protective capabilities of the MFs, the study employs non-linear time-history
analyses (NLTHAs) for both DBE and bDBE conditions. Along these lines, a reduced-order model was developed
from a refined finite element (FE) model of the SMR building using the Craig-Bampton mode synthesis technique.
Then, finite locally resonant modular MFs were designed and analysed using NLTHAs. Specifically, physics-based
ground motion models (GMMs) were used to generate and select seismic triplets that mimicked DBE and bDBE
scenarios for NLTHAs. Successively to achieve improved seismic performance, the optimization of the MFs was
pursued by targeting the optimal number of columns, resonator parameters, and unit cell dimensions. Additionally,
the deployment of inerters was considered, to significantly reduce the size of the MFs and enable their
application in multiple layers for ultra-low frequency attenuation. The overall findings suggest that modular MFs
meet seismic protection requirements, and positively contribute to the standardization process of SMR buildings,
even in areas characterized by beyond-design seismic conditions.
