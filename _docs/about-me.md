Chiara Nardin is Civil engineer fulfilling a Ph.D. programme in Modelling and Simulation at the Department of Civil, Environmental and Mechanical Engineering of the University of Trento. She received her M.Sc. degree with summa cum laude in 2019, discussing a thesis on Evaluation of fragility functions of structural systems for risk analysis based on Markovian processes. She positively attended APESS 2019 - Asia-Pacific-Euro Summer School on Smart Structures Technology ranking first in the challenging competition on data analysis and development of advanced sensor technologies for structural health monitoring systems (SHM). Her research interests rely on risk analysis and fragility assessment of civil and process plant infrastructures, with a special attention to industrial facilities under severe seismic events. She is passionate about design of complex systems that require both mathematical and advanced FE modelling, validated through experimental tests. Recently, she is actively involved, inside the European SERA SPIF’s Project, in experimental campaign’s design phases and in the development of a suitable ground motion model for shaking table tests of a real-scale steel moment resisting frame structure equipped with complex process components. As a result, she is currently authoring and publishing several Journal papers on the aforementioned activities.
